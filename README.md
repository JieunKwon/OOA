# Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)

 <b> Process </b>
  
- Step 1

• Read the requirements

• Find the objects(the nouns)

- Step2

• Read the requirements (again)

• Find relationships(proximity)

- Step 3

• Read the requirements (yet again)

• Find the methods (the verbs)


# Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

<b>   Purpose   </b>

• Grouping (generalizing, classifying) objects into classes

• Establishing relationships/ dependencies between classes (andtherefore objects)

• Defining the functionality that objects of the class must implement


<b> Classes </b>

• Grouping classes into subsystems

• Grouping subsystems into layers / tiers

• Keep raising the level of abstraction to lower the complexity of theproblem
