# Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)

 << Process >> 
  
Step 1

• Read the requirements

• Find the objects(the nouns)

Step2

• Read the requirements (again)

• Find relationships(proximity)

Step 3

• Read the requirements (yet again)

• Find the methods (the verbs)


# Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

<< Purpose >>

• Grouping (generalizing, classifying) objects into classes

• Establishing relationships/ dependencies between classes (andtherefore objects)

• Defining the functionality that objects of the class must implement

<< classes >>
• Grouping classes into subsystems

• Grouping subsystems into layers / tiers

• Keep raising the level of abstraction to lower the complexity of theproblem
